"""
A simple automated reasoning engine example.
 - Representing facts such as: works_hard(jack)
 - Representing negated facts (e.g. not get_job(jack))
 - Rules that use variables (e.g. if student(?x) then passed_exam(?x))
 - A very basic forward chaining inference mechanism
    - Querying for facts (e.g. is there a fact works_hard(jack)?)
